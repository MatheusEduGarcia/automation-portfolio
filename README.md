# Automation Portfolio (Industrial Automation | IIoT | Industry 4.0)

Public portfolio of projects in Industrial Automation, IIoT, Data, and Digital Transformation.

## About
I am an Automation & Digital Transformation Engineer focused on practical industrial solutions:
- PLC / OT systems and shop-floor integration
- IIoT (MQTT, OPC UA), Edge Computing, Unified Namespace concepts
- OEE / Downtime / Andon systems and real-time dashboards
- Data analytics with Power BI, Python, SQL

## What you will find here
This repository is organized as a portfolio hub. Each project has its own folder with:
- Overview and objective
- Architecture / data flow
- Tech stack
- How to run (when applicable)
- Screenshots / demo (when available)

## Projects (starting now)
> I will continuously publish projects here. First items will focus on practical MQTT + Edge + Dashboards.

- **ESP32 MQTT – Practical Series** (in progress)  
  Simulating industrial events and publishing to MQTT topics, ready to connect to dashboards.

- **Node-RED IIoT Flows** (in progress)  
  Data acquisition, state logic, downtime/OEE inference, and MQTT integration.

- **OEE / Andon Dashboard Concepts** (in progress)  
  Structures and examples for real-time monitoring and analysis.

## Repository Structure (suggested)
- `/projects/` → project folders
- `/docs/` → architecture notes, patterns, standards, checklists
- `/templates/` → reusable templates (README, diagrams, configs)

## Tech Stack
MQTT, OPC UA, Node-RED, ESP32, Python, SQL, Power BI, Docker (when applicable).
